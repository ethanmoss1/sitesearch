Changes to make firefox more intergrated into exwm
TODO:
group, allow for customisation and discoverability
docstring, make understanding everything easier
more...

** Ideas for the firefox implementation to exwm (emacs in general) called sitesearch
*** wrapper around the browse-url impementation?
this way i can use exsisting code infrastructure and add in the additional features
*** keybinding in firefox to open sitesearch

** Research
*** Look intoconsult imenu and how it work
[[/home/ethan/.config/emacs/elpaca/repos/consult/consult-imenu.el]]
the thing at point is added to the future hist (how to make default? get url at point?)

*** How to make a package
with use with use-package macro?
dependencies?

*** error with adding to history in consult--multi
the history is based on the minibuffer history, see info add-to-history
